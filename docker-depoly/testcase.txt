2.5 Cache is full
Here to test our cache removing when the max capacity is reached, the size was changed to small size for testing the evicted;
In the program we hand in, we set the capacity quite large, so it may not be easy to see this in log.
If you want to check this functionality, please feel free to adjust the capacity in proxy.cpp line 14.
